        "### **Key Reasons for Handling Missing Data**\n",

        "\n",
        "### **1. NumPy Uses Contiguous Memory Allocation (C-Style Arrays)**\n",
        "- **Python Lists:** Store references (pointers) to objects **spread across memory**.  \n",
        "- **NumPy Arrays:** Use a **single contiguous memory block** (like C arrays), allowing for **faster memory access**.\n",
        "\n",
        "💡 **Example:**  \n",
        "```python\n",
        "import numpy as np\n",
        "import time\n",
        "\n",
        "# Large NumPy array\n",
        "arr = np.arange(10**6)\n",
        "\n",
        "# Large Python list\n",
        "lst = list(range(10**6))\n",
        "\n",
        "# Slicing NumPy array\n",

        "print(\"Python list slicing time:\", end - start)\n",

        "### **2. Views vs. Copies (Memory Efficiency)**\n",
        "- **NumPy Slices Return Views (No Copying)**  \n",
        "  - NumPy does **not create a new object**; it provides a **view** of the original array.\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Python List Slices Create New Lists**  \n",
